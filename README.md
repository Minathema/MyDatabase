# MyDatabase
It creates a user profile consisting of their : name, mobile number, email address, home address

It checks whether each entry is valid. If it's not, it prints a message "This is not valid" and asks again for a valid entry. An empty entry is acceptable and gets registered as "(blank)".

Name and home address are converted to upper case for the registration. Email address is converted to lower case.

There has to be at least one non-blank registered entry for the user profile to be created. If all five entries are "(blank)", a message saying "Profile was not created" is printed. Otherwise, a message saying "Profile created successfully" is printed, along with the new user profile in the following form:


 **EMILY WATSON**
 
 **7911123456**
 
 **(blank)**
 
 **12 ALBION WAY, LONDON**
 

assuming that this user chose to leave their email address entry blank.
